grammar:

  - term: :eq
    description: >
      Performs an exact, case sensitive match on the value with the given case sensitive
      key.
    inputs:
      - name: input
        type: Expression
        description: In Atlas, a Query expression type.
    arguments:
      - name: Key
        type: String
        description: The dimension key. Exact case sensitive match.
      - name: Value
        type: String
        description: The value to match. Exact case sensitive match.
    outputs:
      - name: output
        type: Expression
        description: A Query expression
    since: 1.0
    examples:
      - name,sys.cpu.busy,:eq
      - name,sys.cpu.busy,:eq,node,i-1234,:eq,:and

  - term: :re
    description: >
      Matches the value of a dimension key with a regular expression. A subset of the 
      [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)
      syntax is supported.
    callouts:
      - title: anchoring
        description: >
          Note that the regular expression is implicitly anchored at the start to improve
          performance. E.g an expression `cpu.*` will be treated as `^cpu.*`.
    inputs:
      - name: input
        type: Expression

      - name: Regex
        type: String
        description: >
          A regular expression to run on values for the key to find matches.
