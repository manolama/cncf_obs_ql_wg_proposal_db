title: Selection and Group By with Aggregation

description: >
  The most common query for metrics is to select a subset of time series, group
  the series based on the unique values for a tag or dimension and aggregate the
  results into a single value for each unit of time.

inputs:
  - metric series

uses:
  - type: Alerting
    description: >
      Commonly used when each group has similar behavior and the same static threshold
      can apply to all groups.

  - type: Visualization
    description: >
      Typically plotted in line graphs where patterns can be extracted to determine if
      various groups of groups have similar behaviors or if one or more group exhibit
      outlying behavior.

examples:
  - language: PromQL
    query: >
      sum by (job) (
        http_requests_total{handler="/api/comments"}
      )
    description: >
      Computes the sum of the metric `http_requests_total` where the tag `handler`
      has the value `/api/comments` for every unique `job`.
