  Metrics are numeric measurements of some aspect. In observability it is often a 
  measurement of a system or applications behavior. Many metrics are summaries of 
  or distillations of behavior over a small period of time. 
  
attributes:
  - attribute: identifier
    description: >
      A means of uniquely identifying the measurement amongst a group of measurements 
      from other systems, sources or measurements. 
      
      Earlier identifiers consist of a single string that is often partitioned by a 
      character such as the period to create a hierarchy of data. E.g. 
      `sys.cpu.idle.percent.us-east-1.i-1234`
      
      Later identifiers consisted of a metric name with a set of key/value tags or 
      dimensions. For example `sys.cpu.idle.percent region=us-east-1 instance=i-1234`.
      Variations on dimensional identifiers include merging the metric name with
      the dimensions, multi-value dimension values and key-only dimensions.

  - attribute: timestamp
    description: >
      A point in time associated with the measurement. This may be the time when the
      measurement was taken or reported. It may also be the start or end of an
      interval the measurement represents.

  - attribute: value
    description: >
      Most commonly a single numeric value, particularly from instrumentation sources.
      Some systems support integer values, others IEEE 754 single or double precision
      floating point values. Some systems include multiple numeric values as summaries
      for an interval. E.g. sum, min, max, count, avg, etc. Others may include special
      mergable structures for estimation of quantiles or cardinalities.

uses:
  - title: Control Plane
    description: >
      Since metrics are well defined and easily machine readable, metrics are often
      used in control planes to perform automated tasks such as scaling resources,
      canaries, squeeze tests and distributing work.

  - title: Alerting
    description: >
      Since metrics are well defined and easily machine readable, metrics are 
      used to alert observability consumers of aberrant behavior that may require 
      intervention. 

  - title: Visualization
    description: >
      Metrics are often visualized in various ways though most often in the form of
      line graphs where users can quickly pick out patterns or anomalies.

archtypes:
  - id: metric_dp
    type: Single Value Metric Data Point
    description: >
      A single data point consisting of an identifier, a timestamp when the value was
      recorded and a single numeric value.

  - id: metric_summary_dp
    type: Metric Summary Data Point
    description: >
      A single datum consisting of an identifier, a timestamp when the values were
      recorded or computed and a set of numeric values reflecting summaries such as
      sums, averages, mins or maxes.

  - id: metric_custom_dp
    type: Metric Custom Data Point
    description: >
      A single datum consisting of an identifier, a timestamp when the data was
      recorded or computed, and a custom payload such as a T-Digest or Data Sketch.

subtypes:
  - id: gauge
    type: Gauge
    description: >
      Gauges are often snapshots of behavior in time. For example, capturing the number
      of items present in a processing queue.

  - id: monotonic_counter
    type: Monotonic Counter
    description: >
      One means of tracking behavior is to increment an integer each time an operation
      occurs since an app or device starts. The value grows during the lifetime of 
      the counter and never decreases. Some systems record the raw counter value
      periodically. Users or front-ends must then compute the delta between measurements
      to extract useful information. Aggregations on counters must account for rollover
      and restarts.

  - id: delta
    type: Delta
    description: >
      Often a monotonic counter that has been converted at the measurement source or
      ingress into the delta from the previous measurement. Aggregations on deltas 
      are much simpler than monotonic counters.
